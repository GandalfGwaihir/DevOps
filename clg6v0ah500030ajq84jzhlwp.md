![How to Use Git and GitHub â€“ Version Control Basics for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/git-github.png align="left")

Git and GitHub are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they are actually two different things. Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the differences between Git and GitHub.

### ***Git:***

Git is a distributed version control system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is a tool that allows developers to track changes to code over time, collaborate with other developers, and manage different versions of their code. Git has become one of the most popular version control systems used in software development today.

One of the key features of Git is that it is a distributed version control system. This means that every developer has their own copy of the repository on their local computer. This allows developers to work independently of each other, making changes to their local copy of the codebase without affecting anyone else. Developers can then share their changes with others by pushing their changes to a shared repository, where others can pull those changes and integrate them into their own local copy of the codebase.

Git also provides a powerful branching and merging system, which allows developers to create new branches of their code, experiment with new features, and merge different branches together. This makes it easier for developers to work on different features of the codebase simultaneously without interfering with each other.

Another key feature of Git is its ability to keep a complete history of all the changes that have been made to the codebase. This means that developers can easily track changes over time, and if necessary, revert to an earlier version of the codebase if a mistake is made or if a feature needs to be removed.

Git is a command-line tool that can be used on any operating system. There are also a number of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available that make it easier to use Git, such as GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree, and GitKraken.

### ***GitHub:***

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories. It was created in 2008 by Chris Wanstrath, Tom Preston-Werner, and PJ Hyett, and it has since become one of the most popular platforms used by developers to host and collaborate on software projects.

GitHub provides a number of features that make it easier for developers to work together on code. One of the key features is its social coding functionality, which allows developers to follow each other, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open-source projects. GitHub also provides a powerful issue tracking system that allows developers to create and manage bug reports, feature requests, and other issues related to the codebase.

GitHub provides hosting services for Git repositories, which means that developers can store their code in a secure, centralized location that is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. GitHub also provides a web-based user interface that makes it easy to browse code, view commit histories, and collaborate on code changes.

One of the most popular features of GitHub is its pull request system, which allows developers to propose changes to a codebase and request that those changes be reviewed and merged by other developers. This makes it easier for teams to collaborate on code changes, and ensures that changes are thoroughly reviewed and tested before being merged into the main codebase.

GitHub also provides a number of integrations with other tools and services, such as continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platforms, code analysis tools, and project management software. This makes it easier for developers to automate tasks and streamline their workflows.

In addition to its functionality as a collaboration platform, GitHub has also become a popular destination for open-source software projects. Many open-source projects host their code on GitHub, which makes it easier for contributors to submit bug reports, feature requests, and code changes. GitHub also provides a number of tools and services for open-source projects, such as GitHub Pages, which allows developers to host documentation and websites for their projects.

### ***Features of Git and Github:***

| **Feature** | **Git** | **GitHub** |

### ***Differences between Git and Github:***

| Git | GitHub |
| --- | --- |
| Git is a distributed version control system | GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories |
| Git is a command-line tool that can be used on any operating system | GitHub is a web-based platform that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection |
| Git allows developers to track changes to code over time, collaborate with other developers, and manage different versions of their code | GitHub provides additional features to make it easier for developers to collaborate, such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking |
| Git works offline and does not require an internet connection to function | GitHub requires an internet connection to access its services |

### ***Conclusion:***

In conclusion, Git and GitHub are two different things that are often used together. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories. Both Git and GitHub are essential tools for developers, and understanding the differences between them is important for anyone who wants to work with code.
