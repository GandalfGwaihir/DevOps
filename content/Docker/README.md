# [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, allowing developers to package an application with all its dependencies into a single, self-contained unit that can run on any system that supports Docker.
---
## The Docker platform consists of several components:

* ### Docker Engine: 
The Docker Engine is the core component of the Docker platform. It is a client-server application that runs on the host machine and manages the creation, execution, and destruction of Docker containers.

* ### Docker Hub: 
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry that allows developers to store and share Docker images. Docker images are used to create Docker containers and contain all the necessary dependencies and configuration for the application to run.

* ### Docker CLI: 
The Docker CLI is a command-line interface that allows developers to interact with the Docker Engine and manage Docker containers, images, and other resources.

* ### Docker Compose: 
Docker Compose is a tool that allows developers to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies the process of managing multiple containers and their dependencies.
